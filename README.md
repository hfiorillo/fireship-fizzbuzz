# Fireship coding interview

Thought i'd give the fireship coding interview question a Go ;)

Complete with test cases.

FizzOrBuzz prints out all cases of a given number and will print out whether Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or the number.

IsItFizzOrBuzz will print out whether a given number is Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or None (prints the number itself).
